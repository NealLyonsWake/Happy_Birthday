# Happy Birthday

This is a quick app produced to learn the basic operations of Express, setting up a local server and using the get and send methods.

A request query is sent to /greet with a form submit which determines using a birthday check function if it's your birthday today and wishes you a Happy Birthday, if it is.

The app is available to run locally via: localhost:3000
